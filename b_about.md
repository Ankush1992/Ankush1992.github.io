### Welcome!

I am a 24 year old Software Engineer from New Delhi ,India. My main focus is building backend systems and writing RESTFul API's . I use Java, Groovy and Spring Boot for day to day development. I have a background in Python as well. I am passionate about Open Source Software and I actively work on my OSS projects as a hobby.

I also suffer from several OCDâ€™s , one of them being constant code refactorings. This space on the web shall be devoted to all things programming .I will be talking about anything that interests me, from everyday web development to my experimentations with other languages and frameworks.

I also happen to have a B.Sc Degree in Mathematics from The University of Delhi.

I also like to [read.](https://www.goodreads.com/ankushsharma)
