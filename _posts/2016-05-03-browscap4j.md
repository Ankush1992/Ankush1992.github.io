I was tasked with extracting information from a user agent string when we were building an in house ad serving tracking/reporting web app at the company where I currently work in . The initial and naive approach was to split the user agent strings into arrays and then each array block would contain some valuable information.This approach only takes you so far. There are so many user agent strings out there that you just cannot split these strings willy nilly.
In comes the [Browscap](http://browscap.org/) Open Source Project to the rescue . These guys provide multiple datasets of User agent Strings with their capabilities. Their largest and most comprehensive offering is the `browscap.csv` file which contains the most number of User agent name patterns.(If you have already inspected the browscap project,then you should know what name patterns are).
 
The solution that I developed at work was very crude and tightly coupled with our Spring code base.Anyway, I have now developed a Java library for `browscap.csv` file , called [browscap4j](https://github.com/ankushs92/Browscap4j). 

This tutorial will be devoted on how to use browscap4j and how to integrate it with a Spring boot app.

This library has multiple use cases.Maybe you want to create a full fledged ad serving application wherein you want to serve ads based on the device.Or Maybe you want to perform some log file analysis etc.
The library is not tied down to a specific version of the `browscap.csv` file. Infact, you pass the `browscap.csv` file to the library.
Let's see how it works.We'll extract detailed information from an `Iphone 6` user agent string.

{% highlight java %}

//Path to your csv file on the file system.
File browscapCsv = new File(PATH_TO_CSV);
//Pass the File Object to the Browscap class
Browscap browscap = new Browscap(browscapCsv);
String iphone6UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 8_0_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/600.1.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/8.0 Mobile/12A366 Safari/600.1.4";

BrowserCapabilities browserCapabilities = browscap.lookup(iphone6UserAgent);
String browser = browserCapabilities.getBrowser();
String deviceBrandName = browserCapabilities.getDeviceBrandName(); 
String deviceCodeName = browserCapabilities.getDeviceCodeName();
String deviceName = browserCapabilities.getDeviceName();
String deviceType = browserCapabilities.getDeviceType();
String platform = browserCapabilities.getPlatform();
String platformMaker = browserCapabilities.getPlatformMaker();
String platformVersion = browserCapabilities.getPlatformVersion();
boolean isMobile = browserCapabilities.isMobile();
boolean isTablet = browserCapabilities.isTablet();

System.out.println("Browser ::: " + browser);
System.out.println("deviceBrandName ::: " + deviceBrandName);
System.out.println("deviceCodeName ::: " + deviceCodeName);
System.out.println("deviceName ::: " + deviceName);
System.out.println("deviceType ::: " + deviceType);
System.out.println("platform ::: " + platform);
System.out.println("platformMaker ::: " + platformMaker);
System.out.println("platformVersion ::: " + platformVersion);
System.out.println("isMobile ::: " + isMobile);
System.out.println("isTablet ::: " + isTablet);

{% endhighlight %}

This gives you:
{% highlight conf %}
browser ::: Safari 
deviceBrandName ::: Apple 
deviceCodeName ::: iPhone
deviceName ::: iPhone
deviceType ::: Mobile Phone
platform ::: iOS
platformMaker ::: Apple Inc
platformVersion ::: 8.0
isMobile ::: true
isTablet ::: false
{% endhighlight %}


With basic functionality out the way , we'll now build a Spring Boot app that leverages browscap4j. Browscap4j in itself does not provide any caching capabilities.Therefore,we'll use the wonderful [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) library and use it as our Cache backend for [Spring's Caching abstraction](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html) .
[Here](http://www.java-allandsundry.com/2014/10/spring-caching-abstraction-and-google.html) is a tutorial on how to use Google guava with Spring Cache.

###Scenario
Our app :

1. Expose an endpoint `/browscap/lookup` that accepts user agent as a query string .
2. Processes this user agent string.
3. Checks the Cache. If the BrowserCapabilities is found in the Cache (with user agent as key) ,it is immediately returned from the cache,thereby sparing us of any processing. If it is not in the cache , browscap4j would compute the value and put it in the cache.
4. Returns a BrowserCapabilities object as Json .

We'll need the following Spring-Boot-Starters:

![starters!](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7692552/15216427/a186b9d6-1874-11e6-8f97-3288e487504b.png "Boot starters")


The `Browscap` class is responsible for loading the entire `browscap.csv` file , which should be a one time operation on application startup.We
initialize it as a `Bean` and let Spring handle its lifecycle.
`Important` : Put the `browscap.csv` file in the `src/main/resources` folder. We'll then use Spring's [ResourceLoader](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/ResourceLoader.html) to fetch the csv file from resources folder.

We also use this space to initialize our Guava Cache, and set maximum limit of 1000 on the Cache.
For more details about Guava Caching, check [this](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained) out.

{% highlight java %}
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
	@Autowired
	private  ResourceLoader resourceLoader;
		
	@Bean
	public Browscap getBrowscap() throws IOException{
		final File browscapCsv = resourceLoader.getResource("classpath:/browscap.csv").getFile();
		final Browscap browscap = new Browscap(browscapCsv);
		return browscap;
	}
	
	@Bean(name="browscapCache")
  	public SimpleCacheManager buildBrowscapCache(){
  		final SimpleCacheManager simpleCacheManager = new SimpleCacheManager();
  		final GuavaCache userCache = new GuavaCache("browscapCache",CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
							  .concurrencyLevel(3) //Choose per your own will.
				 			  .maximumSize(1000).build()); 
  		simpleCacheManager.setCaches(Arrays.asList(userCache));
  		return simpleCacheManager;
  	}
}
{% endhighlight %}


The Service layer looks like :

{% highlight java %}
public interface BrowscapService {
	BrowserCapabilities getBrowerCapabilities(String userAgent);
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
@Service
public class BrowscapServiceImpl implements BrowscapService {
	private final Browscap browscap;
	
	@Autowired
	public BrowscapServiceImpl(final Browscap browscap){
		this.browscap = browscap;
	}

	@Override
	@Cacheable(cacheNames="browscapCache",key="#userAgent")
	public BrowserCapabilities getBrowerCapabilities(final String userAgent) {
		Assert.hasText(userAgent,"No userAgent was provided");
		return browscap.lookup(userAgent);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}


So far ,so good. We accept a `userAgent` String as parameter,and return a loaded `BrowserCapabilities` object ,and then put it in the Cache.
Our controller is equally simple:

{% highlight java %}
@RestController
@RequestMapping("browscap/lookup")
public class BrowscapController {
	private final BrowscapService browscapService;
	
	@Autowired
	public BrowscapController(final BrowscapService browscapService){
		this.browscapService = browscapService;
	}
	
	@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.GET)
	public ResponseEntity<?> getBrowserCapabilities(@RequestParam(required=true) final String userAgent)
	{
		return new ResponseEntity<BrowserCapabilities>(browscapService.getBrowerCapabilities(userAgent)
							  ,HttpStatus.OK);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}


That's pretty much it , folks ! We run the app on localhost and hit the endpoint with Postman. The User agent is of my personal laptop : Macbook Pro with OS Yosemite 10.10.2.
