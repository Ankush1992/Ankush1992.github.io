There are several databases out there that provide location lookups based on IP address. Maxmind's [GeoIP](https://www.maxmind.com/en/locate-my-ip-address)
comes to mind.Infact,we had been using GeoLite City	 at work for quite some time. This is a free dataset that Maxmind provides . However,in my humble opinion, the accuracy of the database on city level is quite horrible. I have a Spring Boot project that uses Redis as storage for Geolite City database .Needless to say , the retreival is pretty fast ( although inserting the entire dataset into redis was painfully slow ) . You can check it out [here](https://github.com/ankushs92/Spring-Boot-GeoIP-Redis) .

However,I want to talk about another IP Intelligence Database vendor that I have been exploring.It is pretty much accurate on most IP's that I have tested on it. The name of the vendor is DB-IP and you can view a list of their dataset offerings [here](https://db-ip.com/db/) .

I already had a good experience with Redis when it came to the GeoLite city database, and wanted to explore the idea of loading similar data into the JVM.
I looked around Github and couldn't find any library that does it, so decided to create a Java wrapper myself !

You can see my Github project [here](https://github.com/ankushs92/Java-DB-IP). You can get it via Maven :

{% highlight xml %}
<dependency>
      <groupId>in.ankushs</groupId>
      <artifactId>Java-DB-IP</artifactId>
      <version>1.0</version> 
</dependency>
{% endhighlight %}

Or maybe you prefer gradle :

{% highlight groovy %}

compile('in.ankushs:Java-DB-IP:1.0')

{% endhighlight %}

### Important 
We are loading a 515 mb csv file(after uncompressing) into the JVM. Remember to allocate about 2.5GB-3GB of heap space before you use this library.

Let's see how to use it .

{% highlight java %}
//Pass the location of dbip-city-latest.csv as it is on the file system.
File gzip = new File(PATH_TO_dbip-city-latest.csv);

//Pass the file here.Depending on the heap allocated ,it would take some time to load.Turn on debugging mode and you can how much the file at each point of time.
DbIpClient client = new DbIpClient(gzip);

//And Voila!
GeoEntity geoEntity = client.lookup("31.45.127.255");
String city = geoEntity.getCity();
String country = geoEntity.getCountry();
String province = geoEntity.getProvince();

System.out.println("city : " + city);
System.out.println("province : " + province);
System.out.println("country : " + country);

{% endhighlight %}

Which prints :

{% highlight conf %}
city : Oslo
province : Oslo
country : Norway

{% endhighlight %}

Now let's see how we can use with Spring Boot.

### Scenario

1. We Expose an endpoint `/geoip/lookup` that accepts ip as a query string . For instance, a valid url will be of the form `/geoip/lookup?ip=31.45.127.255' .
2. Use Java DB-IP library to resolve this ip as a GeoEntity object
3. Return GeoEntity as Json.

First, download the dataset by going [here](https://db-ip.com/db/download/city) . Don't extract the file or anything.Simply put the file in the
`src/main/resources` folder. Some visual aid always helps :

![srcmainresources!](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7692552/15226429/4816e034-18a0-11e6-8f2c-339d82c2f46d.png "srcmainresources")


First,we register `DbIpClient` as a Spring Bean as follows :

{% highlight java %}
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
	
	@Autowired
	private ResourceLoader resourceLoader;
	
	@Bean(name="dbIpClient")
	public DbIpClient getDbIpClient() throws IOException{
		final File file = resourceLoader.getResource("classpath:dbip-city-latest.csv.gz").getFile();
		Assert.isTrue(file.exists(),"file does not exist.Make sure the file is placed in src/main/resources with name 'dbip-city-latest.csv.gz'");
		return new DbIpClient(file);
	}
	
}
{% endhighlight %} 

Now that the Spring IOC container manages `DbIpClient` ,we can use it by simply `Autowiring` it in our service class.
The Service layer is written in Groovy.

{% highlight groovy %}
@Service
class GeoIpLookupServiceImpl implements GeoIpLookupService {
	
	private final DbIpClient dbIpClient
	
	@Autowired
	def GeoIpLookupServiceImpl(DbIpClient dbIpClient){
		this.dbIpClient = dbIpClient
	}
	
	@Override
	 GeoEntity lookup(String ip) {
		dbIpClient.lookup(ip)
	}
}

{% endhighlight %}

And for our Controller :

{% highlight groovy %}
@RestController
@RequestMapping("geoip/lookup")
class GeoIpController {

	private final GeoIpLookupService geoIpLookupService
	
	@Autowired
	def GeoIpController(GeoIpLookupService geoIpLookupService){
		this.geoIpLookupService = geoIpLookupService
	}

	@RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.GET)
	ResponseEntity<?> getGeoEntity(@RequestParam(required=true) String ip){
		new ResponseEntity(geoIpLookupService.lookup(ip),HttpStatus.OK)
	}
	
	@ExceptionHandler(InvalidIPException)
	def getErrors(){
		new ErrorMessage(field:"ip",msg:"Invalid IP address")
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}


We'll hit our endpoints with a valid ip address, followed by an invalid ip address,which should produce an error message "Invalid IP address".

Next,just try to pass a random String : 

![withInValidIp!](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7692552/15226887/556a9706-18a2-11e6-9828-89b79109a27c.png "withInValidIp")
